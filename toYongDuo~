To run the same factor with different parameters, you can do the following:
First you should make some changes to the json file of the corresponding factor,take trade imbalance factor as a example:
  I remember the original trigger in the json file is something like, 
  ["*..factors..trade_imbalance_factor..*"]
  you can add different triggers to it,  for example:
   ["*..factors..trade_imbalance_factor1..*"
   , "*..factors..trade_imbalance_factor2..*"]

this way, in the config file,  you can write

factors = {
  trade_imbalance_factor1 = {

  }
  trade_imbalance_factor2 = {

  }
}

the json parser will then know that they are two factors, although they have the same class.
